---

My name is Emelie Wahlström. I've been involved in several Datan Science projects both as Project Management and Data Scientist. I enojoy doing both hands-on and advisory work. I like solving business problems with Advanced Analytics & Machine Learning with focus on deliverable and business value. A project where I got to do both a PM and a DS was when developing a 12 week long Data Science course and then taking it online during Covid-19. I'm passionate about new technologies and love to travel.
