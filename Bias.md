subtitle: Analysis of Discrimination Biases within Data

### My Role
Data Scientist

### Background
During a Combient Mix Hackathon I worked together with Data Scientists Nina Novak and Rahul Biswas to find a solution to discrimination biases 
within datasets.

### Pitch
Any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, 
political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited. 
In the beginning of data usage, we all hoped that we could stop making biased assumptions. We hoped that data would guide us to a more just future. We have come to realize that it is not that easy. Datasets can be as biased as humans. If you try googling Grandma, this is what you will find.

This picture is not a diversity enough representation of grandmas on a global scale. This is because there is no governance 
over data-input to ensure that it's diverse and accurate. If you use this data to make decisions about grandmas, your results are going to be biased. This is a clear example, but what about your data? Do you know that it is not in fact biased?

In the infamous event of 2015, Google built a classification model that classified African-Americans as gorillas. This was not the 
work of trolls, it was the work of a biased dataset.
**Data can not understand cultural sensitivity or what is offensive to us as humans.**

#### Solution
We built a tool/dashboard to help Data Scientist to be aware about the discrimination bias within a dataset. Biases that otherwise would be hard to find.  
We used two data sets to test our tool:
+ Kaggle Heart Failur Data https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data
+ US Adult Income Data https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult
