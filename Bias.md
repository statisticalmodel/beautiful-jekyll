### My Role
Data Scientist during Combient Mix Hackathon

### Background
During a Combient Mix Hackathon I worked in a group together with Data Scientists Nina Novak and Rahul Biswas to find a solution to discrimination biases 
within datasets that can be hard to find. 

### Pitch
Any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, 
political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited. 
In the beguinning of data usage, we all hoped that we could stop making biased assumptionsusings and that data would guide us to a more just future. We have come to realice that it is not that easy. Datasets can be as biased as humans. If you try googling Grandma, this is what you will find.

This pictures is not a diversity enough representation of what grandma means on a global scale. This is because there is no governance 
over data-input to ensure that its diverse and accurate. If you use this data to make decision about grandmas, your results are going to be biased. This is a clear example, but what about your data? Do you know that it is not in fact biased?

In the infamous event of 2015, Google built a classification model that mistakenly classified African-Americans as gorillas. This was not the 
work of trolls, it was the work of a biased dataset.
**Data can not understand cultural sensitivity or what is offensive to us as humans.**

#### Solution
We built a tool/dashboard to help DS to be more aware about the discrimination bias that are hard to see within your dataset. 
We used two data sets to test our tool. 
+ Kaggle Heart Failur Data https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data
+ US Adult Income Data https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult

## Screenshots from Dashboard

There where not enough observations to correctly learn the behaviour for Data Exfiltration.
The model can be used to detect HTTP, Keylogging, OS Fingerprint, Service Scan and TCP attacks.
