### My Role
Data Scientist during Combient Mix Hackathon

### Background
During a Combient Mix Hackathon I worked in a group together with Data Scientists Nina Novak and Rahul Biswas to find a solution to discrimination biases 
within datasets. Any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, 
political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited. 
By using data, we all hoped that we could stop making biased assumptionsusings and that data would guide us to a more just future. 
What we've seen is that datasets are as biased as humans. If you try googling Grandma, this is what you will find. 



Now this is not a diversity enough representation of what grandma means on a global scale. Right!
This is because there is no governance over data-input to ensure that its diverse and accurate. 
If you use this data to make decision about grandmas, your results are going to be biased. 

We also have the example when google classified African-Americans as gorillas. This is not work by trolls its the work of a biased dataset.
Data can not understand cultural sensitivity or what is offensive to humans. 

#### Product
We have built a tool to help DS out, to make us more aware about the discrimination bias that are hard to see within your dataset. 

### Data
We used two data sets 
+ Botnet traffic dataset from IoT networks
+ The dataset suffers from imbalance. _A dataset is considered to be imbalanced when 
the distribution of the classes differs substantially and where the classes of 
interest are rare. This can have the consequence of generating biased results (Fathi Ganji, 2010)._
+ The dataset consist of 1 million observations on 35 attributes from
network traffic. 
+ The data has seven pattern classes, one Normal and six attack classes. 




## Findings 
A set of important variables to identify the network attacks was found. Feature engineered variables properly summarize the behaviours of the
network from the raw network data with good result.
The model managed to classigy all TCP attacks correctly.
There where not enough observations to correctly learn the behaviour for Data Exfiltration.
The model can be used to detect HTTP, Keylogging, OS Fingerprint, Service Scan and TCP attacks.
