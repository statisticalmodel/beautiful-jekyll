During Covid-19 we needed to rethink our business. We were running our Campus, a Data Science course with on premises lectures. We decided to digitize our Campus and create an online platform for the course. **I was chosen as project lead for this initiative.** I was choosen for my Deep knowledge of our organization and a proven history of getting things done. 
- We chose an online learning platform from the company Collegial.
- We created our own Jupyter cluster called CodeHub
- In the end of the course we gave participants the opportunity to mingle with each other by using the Gather platform
